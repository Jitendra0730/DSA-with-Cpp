# 📚 DSA with C++ 

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository! This repo contains my daily practice solutions in **C++**, based on the Apna College DSA course. I’ve structured everything topic-wise to keep the code clean, organized, and easy to track over time.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

DSA with C++  
├── Data Structures/  
│   ├── Array/  
│   ├── String/  
│   └── Vector/ 
├── Functions/  
├── Patterns/  
├── Pointers/  
├── Recursions/
└── ...

Each folder includes multiple C++ files solving specific problems within that topic.

## ✅ Learning Objectives

- Practice DSA problems daily  
- Improve logical thinking and C++ coding skills  
- Build a clean portfolio of solved problems  
- Stay consistent and track learning progress
